# Alternate-Kalman-Filter-
A new mathematical approach in designing Kalman filters for tracking objects moving with constant or varying velocity

Kalman Filter has long been regarded as the optimal solution to many tracking and data prediction tasks. The Kalman filter has played a major role in solving the navigation problem. Before Kalman filtering, navigation was practiced only by highly trained technical specialists. 

Today, it is available as a commodity service for the consumer, requiring no more skill than that needed to use a GPS. The solution to the navigation problem generally requires observations or measurements of some kind and the ability to use that information to determine your location relative to your destination. 

In this poster we will show how Alternate approach of Kalman Filtering can be used to locate the receiver based on measurements from a number of satellites to the receiver.  Although many simplifications are made, some aspects of this problem are still similar to those encountered by a receiver processing measurements from global positioning systems (GPS). All of the simulations will be conducted in two dimensions with either one or two satellites.
